reaching it required four gas valves: hovel, orchard, schoolhouse, gemstone cavern

sealed door looks like it SHOULD lead to somewhere near the underpass, but i haven't found any connections on the other side

to play chess: place pieces where their corresponding rooms are for the day. this lets you gain/switch to a piece's power

pawn = den, bedroom, guest bedroom, storeroom, solarium, walk-in closet, drafting studio, parlour, bunk room (x2?!). you'll basically always have one
knight = security, observatory (both common, but not *guaranteed*)
rook = nook, vault, clock tower
bishop = chapel, attic, rumpus room, bookshop
queen = study
king = office
